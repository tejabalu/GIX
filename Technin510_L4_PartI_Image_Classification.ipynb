Before extracting any features, you should apply Gaussian blurring to your images to get rid of random sensor noice that is common in many lower cost cameras. For this, look into the filters module of scikit-image. Then explore at least two different types of features provided in the feature module of scikit-image. Inspect the size of the feature vectors generated by different methods and what the features look like for different images from the training or testing set. \n",

Hence, keep your code for extracting different features around until you explore classification performance in the next step. You can do that by duplicating the function with different names for different features."
